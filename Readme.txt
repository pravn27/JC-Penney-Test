how to run - you need npm installed 


Unzip and cd filename where package.json resides

1. npm install   (it would install all dependencies , take some time)
2. webpack-dev-server (to run server) - (Note Webpack-dev-server needs to be installed globally - cmd npm install webpack-dev-server -g)
3. localhost:8080/src/client (to watch demo)
